# Tasks — Episode List

## T006: Migrate iOS project to ios/ subdirectory
- Status: done
- Files: `Unblur/` → `ios/`, `Unblur.xcodeproj`
- Done Definition: iOS project moved from `Unblur/` to `ios/` per VERSION_PLAN repo structure. Xcode project opens and builds from `ios/` path. All internal references (source files, assets, tests) resolve correctly.
- Dependencies: none
- Manual Intervention: none

## T007: Project setup + Supabase SDK integration
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur.xcodeproj` (SPM dependency), `ios/Unblur/Services/SupabaseClient.swift`, `ios/Config/Supabase.xcconfig`, `ios/Info.plist`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`
- Done Definition: `supabase-swift` added via SPM. SupabaseClient singleton reads URL + anon key from Info.plist (via xcconfig). xcconfig added to .gitignore. README.md updated: Prerequisites lists `supabase-swift` dependency, Environment Setup documents SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (where to find values, which file to put them in). App builds without errors.
- Dependencies: T006
- Manual Intervention: [HUMAN REQUIRED] Create `ios/Config/Supabase.xcconfig` with actual SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY values from Supabase Dashboard.

## T008: Episode model + EpisodeService
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur/Models/Episode.swift`, `ios/Unblur/Services/EpisodeService.swift`
- Done Definition: `Episode` struct is Decodable and matches `episodes_view` columns. `EpisodeService` protocol defines `fetchEpisodes(cursor:limit:)`. `SupabaseEpisodeService` implements composite cursor pagination via `.or()` filter. Unit test verifies mock service returns expected data.
- Dependencies: T007
- Manual Intervention: none

## T009: Duration + date formatters
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur/Utilities/DurationFormatter.swift`, `ios/Unblur/Utilities/RelativeDateFormatter.swift`, `ios/UnblurTests/DurationFormatterTests.swift`, `ios/UnblurTests/RelativeDateFormatterTests.swift`
- Done Definition: Duration formatter handles 0 → "—", <3600 → "Xm", ≥3600 → "Xh Ym". Relative date formatter handles Today/Yesterday/X days ago/Mon DD/Mon DD, YYYY. All test cases pass.
- Dependencies: none
- Manual Intervention: none

## T010: EpisodeListViewModel
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur/ViewModels/EpisodeListViewModel.swift`, `ios/UnblurTests/EpisodeListViewModelTests.swift`
- Done Definition: @Observable ViewModel manages LoadState (idle/loading/loaded/error). Supports initial load, pagination (with isLoadingMore guard), pull-to-refresh (resets cursor). Composite cursor updated after each page. hasMore set to false when page < 30 items. Tests cover: initial load success/failure, pagination appends data, refresh resets state, duplicate pagination calls ignored.
- Dependencies: T008, T009
- Manual Intervention: none

## T011: EpisodeListView + EpisodeRowView
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur/Views/EpisodeListView.swift`, `ios/Unblur/Views/EpisodeRowView.swift`, `ios/Unblur/Assets.xcassets` (AccentColor), `ios/Unblur/ViewModels/EpisodeListViewModel.swift` (paginationFailed/refreshFailed signals — scope extended per spec §3.3/§4 banner requirement), `ios/UnblurTests/EpisodeListViewModelTests.swift` (error signal tests)
- Done Definition: List displays episodes with artwork (AsyncImage 60×60, placeholder waveform), title (2-line max), relative date, formatted duration. Infinite scroll triggers loadMore at last 5 items. Pull-to-refresh via .refreshable. All states rendered: loading (centered spinner), loaded (list), empty ("No episodes yet"), error ("Unable to load episodes" + retry), offline ("No internet connection" + retry). AccentColor #F28C38 set in Asset Catalog.
- Dependencies: T010
- Manual Intervention: none

## T012: App entry point cleanup
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur/UnblurApp.swift`
- Done Definition: SwiftData/Item references removed. App root view is EpisodeListView with ViewModel injected. App launches and displays episode list from Supabase. Item.swift and ContentView.swift deleted.
- Dependencies: T011
- Manual Intervention: none

## T014: Artwork image loader (downsample + cache)
- Status: done
- Files: `ios/Unblur.xcodeproj` (SPM dependency), `ios/Unblur/Views/EpisodeRowView.swift`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Done Definition: Nuke added via SPM. `EpisodeRowView` replaces `AsyncImage` with `NukeUI.LazyImage` configured with `ImageProcessors.Resize` at 120×120px (2× of 60pt display). Memory with 30 episodes loaded stays under 200 MB (baseline ~700 MB with `AsyncImage`). Scrolling through 100+ episodes is smooth — no main-thread image decoding. Artwork placeholder still shown when URL is nil or load fails. DECISIONS.md records the Nuke choice and reasoning.
- Dependencies: T012
- Manual Intervention: none

## T013: Integration test
- Status: in_progress
- Files: `ios/Unblur/Services/UITestEpisodeService.swift`, `ios/Unblur/UnblurApp.swift`, `ios/Unblur/Views/EpisodeListView.swift` (accessibility identifiers), `maestro/002-episode-list/*.yaml`, `README.md`
- Done Definition: Maestro E2E suite (`maestro test maestro/002-episode-list/`) passes locally on iOS Simulator, covering critical paths + error states per spec acceptance criteria: happy-path (list loads, row content), pagination (infinite scroll past page 1), pull-to-refresh, empty state, initial error + retry, offline state, pagination error row. `UITestEpisodeService` injects deterministic fixtures via `UITEST_MODE` launch argument (no Supabase network dependency). README documents how to run the E2E suite locally. Per ADR-006.
- Dependencies: T014
- Manual Intervention: [HUMAN REQUIRED] Install Java Runtime (`brew install openjdk@17`) and Maestro CLI (already installed at `~/.maestro/bin/maestro`). Set `JAVA_HOME=$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home` before running.
